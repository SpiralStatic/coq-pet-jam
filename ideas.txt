ideas!

- human hand
- spaghetti?? biscetti, even
- hampster ball
- wesel (wsl?)
- dawnglider (pretty, cool, fun)
    - wiggly wesel squad?
- pre-made sprites of h + l
- something like a werewolf but qud related
    - were-puma?? cute tail
- robotic arm
- nine-tails
    - inspo from pixel art and stories
- pet is egg with legs, runs around
    - can make egg body with xml but not hatch it
- k9 robot dog
    - mutant cats? robot dogs!


pet:
hampster ball / electric rat / gen1 starters? / ice frog?
owner:
pokemon trainer
    - truekin beguilinging cybernetic?

pet:
human hand
owner:
handless?

pet:
wesel
owner:
dawnglider



after having looked at what is actually possible!
- playable character cannot have custom inventory / subtype / body etc.
- pet can though
- pc is just build code + tile + colours + description on screen
- sprite can be pokemon trainer inspired
- maybe three variants with different pokemon? we can start with 1 and do more once we finish if we have time and interest
- first pet?
    - psychic hampster ball
- pc?
    - consul, true kin, throwing arm cybernetic (for pokeballs (grenades))
